This Java applet imlements a heuristic topology optimization strategy for the minimzation of dissipation in fluids. The code was originally written to run in a webbrowser and has been slightly modified to run as a stand alone. It has otherwise not been updated size 2007 and is no longer under active development.

## Download
The continuous integration pipeline builds the code and creates an executable Jar for each commit on the `main` branch. The latest jar can be downloaded [here](https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/api/v4/projects/4898/jobs/artifacts/main/download?job=compile_java).

Alternatively, the source code can be downloaded as a zip file from the [latest release](https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/irmb/legacy-lbm-topology-optimization/-/releases).

## Acknowledgements
Grateful for the assistance provided by Peng Liu from Changchun, China, in transforming the JApplet application into a desktop application by inheriting from the JFrame class.
The specific tasks included performing the initialization work of the original JApplet framework in the new constructor and replacing the original browser status bar with a JLabel.
